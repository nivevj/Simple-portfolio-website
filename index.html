        <h3 class="c">2. RETAIL STORE STOCK INVENTORY ANALYTICS | Data Science</h3>

        <p class="content">
          A digitized inventory management system that performs retail store stock analysis to achieve less inventory on hand and more stocks on sale with less manual labor. This addresses the problem of managing the retail store inventory using the time series forecasting algorithm.
          Out of the different models available in this algorithm, the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is preferred as it outperforms the others with its ability to forecast future needs with past seasonal time series data. The newsvendor formula is used in the proposed SARIMA model to calculate the optimal order quantity for the inventory.
          Overall the model predicts the inventory needed to fulfill future customer orders over a period of time with appropriate datasets from the retail store.
